#### **AAA-ICDR Annual Asia Summit 2020** ####

Organised by American Arbitration Association- International Centre for Dispute Resolution – Asia Case Management Centre

* Date: 29 – 30 August

To celebrate a successful year of expansion and continued growth in Asia, the AAA-ICDR  is launching its commemorative Annual Summit to explore dispute management in the decade that was and the decade that will be. This Summit will bring a unique perspective for different stakeholders to examine contemporary issues such as a communication gap between the end user and the service provider. Come join us as  corporates (businesses and general counsels) battle it out with dispute resolution practitioners (law firms, institutions and arbitrators) on multiple facets of the dispute management process. The insights we all stand to glean will help us understand differing perspectives to bring some much needed cohesion in dispute management. From real debate sessions to rapid fire questions, skills based workshop and Young and International focused events, there is something in this Summit for all stakeholders including takeaways that matter in day to day life. We will also celebrate and thank all our stakeholders for a successful first year of our Asia Case Management Centre with a cocktail reception and Anniversary dinner.  The Summit will see the launch of our commemorative Asia Dispute Resolution Journal that takes a look at the decade that was for Dispute Resolution in Asia.
