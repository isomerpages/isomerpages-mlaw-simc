    section-description: In 2019, history was made when Singapore hosted the signing ceremony where 46 countries signed the Singapore Convention on Mediation, with more coming on board after. With Singapore, Fiji, Qatar and Saudi Arabia now having deposited their respective instruments of ratification, the Convention will enter into force on 12 September 2020, marking yet another momentous occasion.
    # Organised by the Singapore Ministry of Law together with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the Conference will feature panel discussions and technical workshops, and will bring together legal practitioners, dispute resolution specialists, business executives and government officials from around the world to discuss emerging issues relating to dispute resolution, international trade law and business. The Singapore Convention Conference 2020 will be part of the Singapore Convention Week, a series of events related to dispute resolution, which will run from 27 August to 4 September 2020.
