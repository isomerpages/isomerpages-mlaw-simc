  <br><b>Event description:</b> The Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA)  will launch the preliminary findings of the  2021 SIDRA International Dispute Resolution Survey on the sidelines of the Singapore Convention Week 2021 on 9 September. The SIDRA Survey, which is now in its second iteration and commissioned by the Singapore Ministry of Law, examines how businesses and their legal representatives make decisions about resolving cross-border commercial disputes and investor-state disputes. It is the first of its kind in Asia and beyond and provides a unique perspective because the respondents are all users of cross-border dispute resolution mechanisms such as international commercial arbitration, international commercial litigation, investor-state dispute settlement, mixed-mode mechanisms, and international commercial mediation. The launch will present the preliminary findings of the SIDRA Survey 2021, followed by a panel discussion of esteemed speakers engaged in the fields of international dispute resolution.
