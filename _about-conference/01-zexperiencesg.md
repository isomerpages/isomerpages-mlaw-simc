![Experience Singapore](/images/expsg-gardens.jpeg/)

Foreign delegates are invited to join three curated programmes where you will cruise past Singaporeâ€™s unique skyline, stroll amid lush greenery, and experience our hawker culture and heritage.

You may register for these programmes:
* when you register for the conference online; or
* by contacting the Organising Secretariat at [SgConvention@mlaw.gov.sg](mailto:sgconvention@mlaw.gov.sg).

The programmes are complimentary. Transport will be provided from and back to the conference hotel.

Capacity is limited and registration is on a first-come-first-served basis.
