### **Introduction** 
The Singapore Convention on Mediation (the “Singapore Convention” or “Convention”) is a uniform and efficient framework for international settlement agreements resulting from mediation. It applies to international settlement agreements resulting from mediation, concluded by parties to resolve a commercial dispute.

The Singapore Convention will facilitate international trade and commerce by enabling disputing parties to easily enforce and invoke settlement agreements across borders. Businesses will benefit from mediation as an additional dispute resolution option to litigation and arbitration in settling cross-border disputes.

signing ceremony to show their support for the Convention. Subsequently, [more countries signed the Convention](/convention/status/).
* In February 2020, the Singapore Parliament passed the [Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 (“the Act”)](https://www.parliament.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/singapore-convention-on-mediation-bill-5-2020.pdf). The introduction of the Act, which gives effect to the Convention, is a significant step in Singapore’s efforts to strengthen its international commercial dispute resolution framework.
