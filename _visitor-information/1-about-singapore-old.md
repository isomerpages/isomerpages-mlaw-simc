### **About Singapore**

Singapore is a sunny, tropical island in South-east Asia, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. The city-state is 710 square kilometres and inhabited by five million people from four major communities; Chinese (majority), Malay, Indian and Eurasian. Since its independence in 9 August 1965, the country has adopted a parliamentary democracy system.  Currently, the government and the cabinet are led by Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong while President Halimah Yacob is the Head of State.

Ideally positioned in South-east Asia, where the rest of the region is just a hop, skip and jump away, Singapore is a thriving metropolis offering a world-class infrastructure, a fully integrated island-wide transport network, dynamic business environment, vibrant living spaces and a rich culture largely influenced by the four major communities in Singapore with each offering different perspective of life in Singapore in terms of culture, religion, food, language and history.

One of the reasons that Singapore proves to be such an attraction as a home is the ease of living, particularly in terms of residence, transportation and governance system. Over the years, Singapore has made significant strides in many areas and has attracted an encouraging number of international accolades which recognise the city as vibrant and world-class.

Singapore is ranked fourth globally according to the 2018 Global Financial Centres Index (GCFI) survey, it is a regional gateway for Reminbi (RMB) with liquid capital markets. Its strategic location also makes it the preferred choice for businesses.  

So whether it's the arts and cultural exchanges, the creation of cutting-edge innovation to enrich the lives of the communities at home or abroad, or the coming together of world-class minds to spark new business opportunities locally and internationally, Singapore is simply, the place where worlds meet. 

### **Singapore’s Legal Industry**

The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is constantly exploring and growing practice areas and the country’s legal capabilities beyond dispute resolution and debt restructuring. It has ratified The Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements which improves enforcement of Singapore Court judgements and introduced third-party framework as additional financing options for businesses in international commercial arbitration. MinLaw works with both public and private sectors to strengthen Singapore’s position as a legal hub. The Singapore Government has launched various programmes such as the public sector transformation and initiatives to promote a conducive environment for innovation and encourage the development of legal tech and other advancements in law. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) recorded the highest number of cases in 2017. 452 cases were filed in 2017 from parties in 58 countries which involved SGD$5.3 billion (US$4.07 billion). The country’s common law tradition has also led to international practitioners to build up a presence.
