                          <p align="justify">Ministers and Senior Officials from 67 States around the world arrived in Singapore today for the signing of a new treaty on mediation which will provide a much needed boost to international trade and commerce. They were received by Singapore Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam at an official Welcome Reception at the Clifford Pier, a historic site of trade and commerce, against the iconic skyline of the Marina Bay in Singapore.

                          <p align="justify">In December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the new Convention on mediation and authorised for the signing ceremony to be held in Singapore and for the Convention to be named the “Singapore Convention on Mediation”. The Singapore Convention on Mediation will strengthen the international dispute resolution framework, provide businesses greater certainty and assurance and help facilitate international trade and commerce. It is the first UN treaty to be named after Singapore.</p>

                          <p align="justify">Minister Shanmugam said, “The attendance by more than 60 countries, at this Singapore Convention, within shows the importance they place on the Convention, and the benefits it will bring to international trade and commerce. I am pleased to welcome our distinguished guests who have come for the signing of the Convention. We look forward to making history together, at the signing ceremony tomorrow.”</p>
