                          <p>Minister Shanmugam said, “This is a significant week for Singapore. We have the signing of the Singapore Convention, by 46 countries, showing immediate commitment to a rules based order in international trade. The EU and its member states also actively participated in the drafting of the Convention in the UN. In addition, this week in Singapore: INSOL International, a worldwide federation of 44 member associations, comprising restructuring and insolvency professionals, launched its first overseas office outside of London, in Singapore, to serve as its Asian hub; the American Arbitration Association - International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA-ICDR), a leading provider of alternative dispute resolution services for parties in commercial disputes, will open its Asia Headquarters and Case Management Centre in Singapore; the International Bar Association held its inaugural Asia Pacific Arbitration Conference yesterday; the newly refurbished
                              Maxwell Chambers Suites, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex
                              that houses the largest number of case management offices of dispute resolution
                              institutions worldwide, will have its grand opening tomorrow. All of this will help
                              Singapore play an important role in helping in international business and finance
                              flows.”</p>

                            <p>The Singapore Convention on Mediation was adopted by consensus at the UN
                                General Assembly on 20 December 2018. It is the first UN treaty to be named
                                after Singapore. The new international treaty will provide for the cross-border
                                enforcement of mediated settlement agreements, give businesses greater
                                certainty and assurance, and facilitate international trade and commerce.</p>
